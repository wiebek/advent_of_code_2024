    Each antenna is tuned to a specific frequency indicated by a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or digit.
    You create a map (your puzzle input) of these antennas.

    The signal only applies its nefarious effect at specific antinodes based on the resonant frequencies of the antennas.
    In particular, an antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same
    frequency - but only when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other. This means that for any pair of
    antennas with the same frequency, there are two antinodes, one on either side of them.
